## Name: CSC30 Major Project--Bomberman

## Game introduction:
Gameplay involves strategically placing down bombs, which explode in multiple directions after a certain amount of time, 
in order to destroy obstacles and kill enemies and other players. The player can pick up various power-ups, giving them benefits such as 
larger explosions or the ability to place more bombs down at a time. The player is killed if they touch an enemy or get caught up in a
bomb's explosion, including their own, requiring players to be cautious of their own bomb placement.
